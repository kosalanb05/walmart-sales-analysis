# Walmart Sales Analysis Report

**ðŸ”° Project Background**

Walmart, one of the largest retail chains globally, operates across multiple cities and
branches, offering a wide range of products, including electronics, fashion, home goods, and
groceries. Founded in 1962, Walmart has grown into a retail giant, serving millions of
customers worldwide. I am partnering with the Head of Sales and Operations to analyze
Walmart's sales data and extract actionable insights to improve performance across sales,
product, and customer experience teams. The goal is to identify trends, optimize operations,
and deliver data-driven recommendations to drive sustainable growth and enhance
customer satisfaction.

**ðŸ“‘ Executive Summary**

Walmart's post-pandemic sales analysis of **320,887** transactions across three citiesâ€”Naypyitaw, 
Mandalay, and Yangonâ€”highlights key trends and growth opportunities. **Health & Beauty** and **Home & Lifestyle** 
emerge as top-performing categories, peaking on weekends (e.g., Health & Beauty reaching **$390.02** on Saturdays).
In contrast, **Fashion Accessories** and **Electronics** struggle midweek, hitting lows on Wednesdays (**$243.57**) and Mondays (**$243.99**).

Regional sales insights show Naypyitaw leading in total sales (**$110 490.93**) and average spending per transaction (**$337.89**), 
while Mandalay records the lowest total sales (**$104 534.93**) but maintains strong per-transaction spending (**$317.74**). 
Yangon exhibits high transaction volume but lower average spending (**$312.27** per purchase), suggesting an opportunity for upselling and bundling strategies.

Customer behavior trends indicate that female shoppers dominate afternoon sales (**46K** transactions), while male shoppers prefer evenings (**27K** transactions). 
Loyalty program members spend more on average (**$327.91**) than non-members (**$317.06**), reinforcing the value of membership-driven engagement. 
Payment preferences further reveal males favoring e-wallets (**184** transactions), while females prefer cash (**178**) and credit cards (**161**), 
suggesting tailored payment incentives could drive further engagement.

To maximize growth, Walmart should consider midweek promotions for low-performing categories, loyalty program enhancements (e.g., tiered rewards), 
and regional strategies to increase foot traffic in Mandalay. Expanding successful product lines, improving digital experiences (e.g., optimizing the mobile app),
and refining sales strategies based on customer behavior will strengthen market position, drive higher revenue, and enhance long-term customer loyalty.
